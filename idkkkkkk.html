<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My hobby is biking. I like to bike every weekend with my sister at a nearby park. I am 9 years old and my grade is 4th grade. Now I know that biking is a great habit and helps with your excercise and is great for physical health. I like to bike because when I am going super fast, the wind blows back in my face and I get cooled down if it was a hot day. Biking is a great source of exercise and everyone should do it regularly, because it is great for your legs. I love biking!</span></p>
